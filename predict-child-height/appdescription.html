<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
<p>This simple Shiny application uses the data from Galton’s 1886 study (dataset <code>GaltonFamilies</code> in the <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/HistData/">HistData</a> R package), to try and predict (using a linear regression model), a child’s height in centimeters, given the father’s and mother’s height, as well as the child’s gender.</p>
<p>It is very interesting that even recent studies on this topic (like the one by Yurii S Aulchenko, 2009) based con genetic marker data, do no better for height prediction than Galton’s simple procedure that uses the “mid-parent” height for the same purpose.</p>
<p>Also, the application does not try to do range checks for the parent’s heights, so you will get an answer even with unlikely values. Perhaps, checks will be implemented in a future version of this Shiny application.</p>
