gf <- GaltonFamilies
# convert from inches to cm
library(dplyr)
gf <- gf %>% mutate(fh=father*2.54,
                    mh=mother*2.54,
                    mph=midparentHeight*2.54,
                    ch=childHeight*2.54)

```

Background
========================================================

- I used the dataset `GaltonFamilies`, in the
  [HistData](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/HistData/) R package, to
  create a predictive model for child's height.
- The heights in the dataset were converted to centimenters using
  the equivalence: 1 inch = 2.54 cm.
- The model predicts a child's height (in cm.), given
  the father's and mother's heights (in cm.), as well as the child's gender.
- The dataset originates from an 1886 study by Francis Galton (*vide infra*), in which he
  concludes that using the average height of the parents (the "mid-parent"
  height) is a sufficient predictor of his/hers stature.

Looking at the correlation
========================================================

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.height=5}
library(GGally)
ggpairs(gf[c("ch", "fh", "mh", "mph", "gender")], binwidth=10)
```

<small>
Height variables (in cm.): **ch** (child),
**fh** (father), **mh** (mother), and **mph** (mid-parent).
The **gender** factor: female/male.

***

The child's height is moderately correlated with the father,
mother and midparent's heights.

Considering the sample distributions of
heights by gender, we observe a distinct difference, so the
child's gender is an important factor in any predictive model.

Picking a linear model
========================================================

For the model, I used Galton's assumption which considers only
the mid-parent's height,
but also tried other models that included the child's gender, as
summarized below:

```{r echo=FALSE}
modsum <- data.frame(
            Model=c(
              "childHeight ~ midparentHeight",
              "childHeight ~ midparentHeight + gender",
              "childHeight ~ father + mother + gender"
            ),
            `Adjusted R-squared`=c(
              0.102,
              0.6324,
              0.6342
            )
          )
kable(modsum)
```

The last model gives a slightly better fit, and is the one I used for the Shiny App:
"[Predict the height of your child](https://jmcastagnetto.shinyapps.io/predict-child-height)".


Final thoughts
========================================================

- The Shiny App brings to life in a simple and interactive way, research done
  in Victorian times <tt>:-)</tt>
- I did not implement range validation in the `serve.R` code, so you could
  put non-sensical values (negative, for example), and you will still get a
  prediction... Perhaps that could be done in the next version of the app.
- You would think that with genetic data we can now do better predictions of
  a phenotypical trait such as height, but that is not the case (*vide infra*),
  the old Victorian method is not only cost effective, but also more robust.
